## Gameplay

### Placement of the ships

Before a round starts both players have to place their ships onto the playround. Each player has to place 1 aircraft carrier, 1 battleship, 2 submarines and 1 destroyer.  

A ship can be placed horizontal or vertical but never diagonal. Also it's not allowed to place 2 ships side by side. However ships can be placed to diagonally adjacent fields i.e. if a ship ends at field D5 another ship may start at field E6.  

If both players have placed their ships the game starts.

### A players round

If it's a players turn he can select any field to shoot at. When the opponent has placed a ship at the aimed field that ship will be hit. Both players will be notified about the position of the shot and if the shot hit. Additionaly the position of the shot will be marked on the playground of both players. After that it's the other players turn.

#### Sinking a ship

If every field the ship is placed on was hit, the ship is sunken. Both players will get informed about the type of the sunken ship and where the ship was placed.

### Winning

If a player has sunk all of the other ships, he has won.
